# Go System Programming

**Build modern and concurrent applications for Unix and Linux systems using Golang**

## What is this course about?
System software and applications are usually created using low level programming languages such as C/C++. Go is a modern language which combines simplicity, concurrency and performance which makes it a great candidate for building system applications. The course is a guide for building system applications for Linux and OS X using Golang.

This course covers the following exciting features:
* Gain knowledge of Unix system programming 
* Understand and use Daemon Processes in dependency implementation 
* Explore and use the Go standard library to encode complex data structures 
* Gain insights into Golang internals 
* Master the Go concurrency model and its patterns 
* Become adept at implementing the Sync and Atomic Packages 
* Understand Go allocation and Memory allocation 


## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
<meta name="go-import" content="package-name vcs repository-url">
```

**Following is what you need for this course:**
If you are a developer who wants to learn system programming with Go, this course is for you. Although no knowledge of Unix and Linux system programming is necessary, intermediate knowledge of Go will help you understand the concepts covered in the course

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the course (Chapter 1-16).
