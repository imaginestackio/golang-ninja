# Frontend Libraries

In the previous chapter, we looked at different frameworks for building frontend applications. In this chapter, we will look at the different frontend libraries that are useful for building web applications. Frontend libraries are predefined functions and classes that can help speed up the development time when building frontend applications by providing functionality we’d otherwise have to build and develop ourselves. In this chapter, we will be looking at the following libraries:

-   `Vuetify`
-   `Buefy`
-   `Vuelidate`
-   `Cleave.js`

Having completed this chapter, you will have explored the following:

-   Validating data with `Vuelidate`
-   Better input handling with `Cleave.js`
-   Working with different UI components using `Vuetify`

In this chapter, there will be sample code that is shared using [codesandbox.io](http://codesandbox.io) and [jsfiddle.net](http://jsfiddle.net), which will make it easier for you to experiment with.

Let’s begin our journey by looking into Vuetify in the next section.

Just Imagine

# Understanding Vuetify

In [_Chapter 7_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor128), _Frontend Frameworks_, we learned about the Vue framework, which is a rich frontend framework that allows frontend code to be extended and maintained easily. Vuetify ([https://vuetifyjs.com](https://vuetifyjs.com)) provides a lot of user interface components out of the box, ready to be used by applications. The framework also allows developers to style the user interfaces to their needs.

In this section, we will learn about Vuetify, which is a Material-based design framework that is built on top of Vue. Material is the Design Language made popular by Google across their web apps and Android applications – you can find out more at [https://m3.material.io/](https://m3.material.io/) –and is a very popular choice.

Just Imagine

# Setting up Vuetify

We are going to take a look at the example code inside the `chapter08/vuetify/components` directory. The example code demonstrates how to use the `Vuetify` framework. Before running the sample code, make sure you run the following command from inside the `chapter08/vuetify/components` directory to install all the necessary components:

```markup
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, run the sample code using the following command:

```markup
npx vue-cli-service serve
```

Once the server is up and running, you will get an output as shown in _Figure 8__.1_:

![Figure 8.1: Output from running npx](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_8.01_B18295.jpg)

Figure 8.1: Output from running npx

You can access the application using the URL specified in the output – for example, http://localhost:8080. _Figure 8__.2_ shows the output of the application:

![Figure 8.2: Output from the sample app](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_8.02_B18295.jpg)

Figure 8.2: Output from the sample app

The sample app displays the different components that are available inside Vuetify. As you can see, there are components available for radio button groups and color pickers, among many others.

In the next section, we will look at how we use Vuetify in the sample app and how things are wired up together.

Just Imagine

# Using UI components

There are many components provided with Vuetify but in this section, we will just talk about a few of them to get an idea of how to use them. The example code uses components such as a color picker, button, badge, and so on.

_Figure 8__.3_ shows the directory structure of the example. All of the source files are inside the `src/` folder:

![Figure 8.3: The directory structure of a Vuetify sample app](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_8.03_B18295.jpg)

Figure 8.3: The directory structure of a Vuetify sample app

The `main.js` host code for initializing Vue and Vuetify is shown in the following snippet:

```markup
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import vuetify from './plugins/vuetify';
Vue.config.productionTip = false
new Vue({
 vuetify,
 render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
```

The code looks like any other Vue-based application except it adds the Vuetify framework, which is imported from the `plugins/vuetify` directory, as shown in this snippet:

```markup
import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuetify from 'vuetify/lib/framework';
Vue.use(Vuetify);
export default new Vuetify({});
```

Vuetify is initialized in the code as a plugin using the `Vue.use()` function call and exported to be made available to other parts of the code.

Now that the initialization is out of the way, let’s take a look at how the sample is using the Vuetify components. The code snippet here from `App.vue` shows how the sample code uses the Color Picker component of Vuetify:

```markup
<template>
 <v-app>
   <v-container>
    ...
     <v-row>
       <v-col>
         Color Picker
       </v-col>
       <v-col>
         <v-color-picker/>
       </v-col>
     </v-row>
   </v-container>
 </v-app>
</template>
```

The tags that can be seen in the snippet – `<v-row>`, `<v-col>`, `<v-container>`, and so on – are all Vuetify components. The components can be configured through the available properties; for example, if we look at the component documentation ([https://vuetifyjs.com/en/api/v-row/#props](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/api/v-row/#props)) for `<v-row>`, we can see that we can set different parameters, such as alignment.

In this section, we learned about Vuetify and how to use the components provided, and also how to wire things together to use it in a Vue-based application. In the next section, we will look at different user interface libraries that are more lightweight compared to Vuetify. We will start by looking at Buefy in the next section.

Just Imagine

# Understanding Buefy

Buefy is another user interface framework that is built on top of Bulma. Bulma ([https://bulma.io/](https://bulma.io/)) is an open source CSS project that provides different kinds of styles for HTML elements; the CSS file can be viewed at the following link: [https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/css/bulma.css](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/css/bulma.css).

Let’s take a quick look at an example web page that uses Bulma CSS. This will give us a better idea of what Bulma is all about and also give us a better understanding of how Buefy is using it.

Just Imagine

# Bulma sample

Open the sample `chapter08/bulma/bulma_sample.html` file in your browser, and the HTML page will look like _Figure 8__.4_:

![Figure 8.4: Bulma example page](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_8.04_B18295.jpg)

Figure 8.4: Bulma example page

The following code snippet shows the Bulma CSS file used in the web page:

```markup
<head>
   ...
   <link rel="stylesheet" href=
      "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.3/css/
       bulma.min.css">
</head>
```

The web page uses different HTML elements tags styled using the Bulma CSS, as seen in the following code snippet:

```markup
<section class="hero is-medium is-primary">
   <div class="hero-body">
       <div class="container">
           <div class="columns">
               ...
           </div>
       </div>
   </div>
</section>
<section class="section">
   <div class="container">
       <div class="columns">
           <div class="column is-8-desktop
                       is-offset-2-desktop">
               <div class="content">
                   ...
               </div>
           </div>
       </div>
   </div>
</section>
```

Now that we have an idea about what Bulma is and how to use it for a web page, we will take a look at setting up Buefy in the next section.

Just Imagine

# Setting up Buefy

We are going to look at the Buefy example that is found inside the `chapter8/buefy` directory. Make sure you are inside the directory and run the following command:

```markup
npm install
npx vue-cli-service serve
```

Open the server in your browser and you will see output like _Figure 8__.5_:

![Figure 8.5: Buefy sample output](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_8.05_B18295.jpg)

Figure 8.5: Buefy sample output

Just Imagine

# UI components

The web page displays different components available in Buefy, such as a slider, a clickable button with a dropdown, and a breadcrumb.

Initializing Buefy is the same as initializing any other Vue plugin. It looks the same as what we went through in the previous section when we looked at Vuetify. The code will initialize Vue by using Buefy as stated in the `Vue.use(Buefy)` code:

```markup
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import Buefy from "buefy";
Vue.use(Buefy);
new Vue({
 render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
```

One of the components that we are using in our sample app is `carousel`, which displays a user interface like a slideshow. To create `carousel`, it is just a few lines of code, as shown in the following code snippet, using the `<``b-carousel>` tag:

```markup
<!--example from https://buefy.org/documentation-->
<template>
 <section>
   <div class="container">
     <b-carousel>
       <b-carousel-item v-for="(carousel, i) in carousels"
        :key="i">
         <section :class="`hero is-medium
                           is-${carousel.color}`">
           <div class="hero-body has-text-centered">
             <h1 class="title">{{ carousel.text }}</h1>
           </div>
         </section>
       </b-carousel-item>
     </b-carousel>
   </div>
...
 </section>
</template>
```

Like `carousel`, there are many different pre-built components available in Buefy that can help design complex user interfaces.

In the next section, we will look at how we can use the Vuelidate library as a way to perform validation on the data we capture and present in our user interface to ensure we interpret our customers’ data correctly.

Just Imagine

# Validating data entry with Vuelidate

If your app does anything interactive, it’s likely that it will handle user-entered data, which means you must check whether what the users are providing is valid input.

Input validation libraries can be used to ensure only valid data is entered by the user and provide feedback as soon as data is received. This means we’re validating as soon our user hits that input field!

We’re going to explore HTML form validation in the frontend and the difference between input and value validation. It’s also important to note that no matter the validation in the frontend, it’s no substitute for validation in the backend and of the API endpoints. Our goal in the frontend is to prevent the user from making errors; however, you’ll never stop bad guys from submitting bad data to your app.

We can look at frontend validation through two lenses, as there’s a myriad of solutions out there, but we’ll contrast two options and show a working solution – the first is that of validating input, and the other is the validation of values.

If we only want to validate the input, we could use the `vee-validate` library, which works by having you write the rules inside the `<template>` of your code. For example, see the following:

```markup
<script>
Vue.use(VeeValidate);
var app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    email: '',
  },
  methods: {
    onSubmit: function(scope) {
      this.errors.clear(scope);
      this.$validator.validateAll(scope);
    }
  }
});
</script>
<template>
<div>
  <form v-on:submit.prevent="onSubmit('scope')">
    <div>
      <div v-for="error in errors.all('scope')">
        {{error}}
      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <label>Email Address</label>
      <input type="text" v-model="email"
        name="Email Address" v-validate data-scope="scope"
        data-rules="required|min:6|email">
    </div>
    <div>
      <button type="submit">
        Send
      </button>
    </div>
  </form>
  <div class="debug">
    email: {{email}}<br>
  </div>
</div>
</template>
```

This inline validation – wherein we perform `ValidateAll()` on submitting data – will allow us to validate the contents of the data using predefined rules, such as a field being required, its minimum length, or that it must be a valid email ID, for example. If invalid data is entered, we can iterate through the errors and present them to the user:

![Figure 8.6: Validation error message](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_8.06_B18295.jpg)

Figure 8.6: Validation error message

You can see this on the JS Playground website `JSFiddle` at the following link: [https://jsfiddle.net/vteudms5/](https://jsfiddle.net/vteudms5/).

This is useful for simple validation, but when we want to add additional logic against values and collections of values, rather than just individual inputs, this is where libraries such as Vuelidate become powerful.

With Vuelidate, you’ll notice that the validation is decoupled from the template code we write, unlike the inline validation done in the `vee-validate` example. This allows us to write the rules against the data model rather than the inputs in our template.

In Vuelidate, the validation results in a validation object referenced as `this.$v,` which we can use to validate our model state. Let’s rebuild our previous example to demonstrate how we going to use Vuelidate to validate the data – this sample is at [https://jsfiddle.net/34gr7vq0/3/](https://jsfiddle.net/34gr7vq0/3/):

```markup
<script>
Vue.use(window.vuelidate.default)
const { required, minLength,email } = window.validators
new Vue({
    el: "#app",
  data: {
      text: ''
  },
  validations: {
      text: {
        required,
      email,
      minLength: minLength(2)
    }
  },
  methods: {
      status(validation) {
        return {
        error: validation.$error,
        dirty: validation.$dirty
      }
    }
  }
})
</script>
<template>
<div>
  <form>
    <div>
      <label>Email Address</label>
      <input v-model="$v.text.$model"
        :class="status($v.text)">
      <pre>{{ $v }}</pre>
    <div>
  </form>
</div>
</template>
```

The resulting output shows us the `$v` object. The `required`, `email`, and `minLength` fields are firing when you type in the box. In our example, when we type in [nick@bar.com](mailto:nick@bar.com), the fields change value:

![Figure 8.7: Illustration of the browser output from our JSFiddle sample](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_8.07_B18295.jpg)

Figure 8.7: Illustration of the browser output from our JSFiddle sample

Although similar to the `vee-validate` implementation in style, by utilizing the `$v` object concept and allowing that to be the source of validation, we can connect it to additional inputs across multiple forms and validate the entire collection. For example, if we had multiple fields, such as a name, email, users, and tags across `formA` and `formB`, we would be able to create the validation as follows:

```markup
...
validations: {
  name: { alpha },
  email: { required, email }
  users: {
    minLength: minLength(2)
  },
  tags: {
    maxLength: maxLength(5)
  },
  formA: ['name', 'email'],
  formB: ['users', 'tags']
}
```

There’s a large collection of available validators for Vuelidate that we can import. This gives us access to validators such as conditionally required fields; length validators; email, alpha/alphanum, regex, decimal, integer, and URL options; and many more that are accessible by importing the `validators` library:

```markup
import { required, maxLength, email } from '@vuelidate/validators'
```

The full list is available on the Vuelidate website at [https://vuelidate-next.netlify.app/validators.html](https://vuelidate-next.netlify.app/validators.html).

# Better input handling with Cleave.JS

As we’ve just seen, getting data from your users in the right shape and form can be a challenge – be it a date in a YYYY/MM format, a phone number with a prefix, or other more structured input types.

We looked at validation previously, but you can further help your users by providing visual clues and feedback as they type to prevent them from reaching the end with validation errors – libraries such as those provided by the popular credit card and online payments processor. Stripe does a great job at helping users enter their credit card info correctly, but for those of us on a budget, we can use Cleave. js for a similar experience.

![Figure 8.7: Credit card validation (image from https://nosir.github.io/cleave.js/)](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_8.08_B18295.png)

Figure 8.7: Credit card validation (image from https://nosir.github.io/cleave.js/)

Frustratingly, Vue isn’t supported as a first-class citizen but there’s no reason we can’t set up the directive, which is available at [codesandbox.io](http://codesandbox.io) here – [https://bit.ly/3Ntvv27](https://bit.ly/3Ntvv27). _Figure 8__.8_ shows how the validation will work for [codesandbox.io](http://codesandbox.io):

![Figure 8.8: Example of our Cleave.js example on codesandbox.io](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_8.09_B18295.jpg)

Figure 8.8: Example of our Cleave.js example on codesandbox.io

It’s not as pretty in my hardcoded sample (the CSS is left as an exercise for you!) but the key part from the sandbox sample is how we overload `custom-input` with our `cleave` directive by doing the following:

```markup
<template>
<div id="app">
  <div>
   <custom-input
    v-cleave="{ creditCard: true,
    onCreditCardTypeChanged: cardChanged, }"
    v-model="ccNumber" />
</div>
<pre>
{{ ccNumber }}
{{ cardType }}
</pre>
</template>
```

In the future, it would be great to see Cleave.js incorporate a first-party implementation for Vue but until then, a number of npm packages exist to skip over the setup for our sample and provide a similar effect that will allow us to create beautiful experiences for our users.

To follow the status of Cleave.js official support, you can check out [https://github.com/nosir/cleave.js/blob/master/doc/vue.md](https://github.com/nosir/cleave.js/blob/master/doc/vue.md).

With Cleave.js, we have reached the end of this chapter.

# Summary

In this chapter, we learned about several frontend libraries and tools to help us to iterate through code and design faster when building the frontend user interface for our product.

We’ve looked at using Vuetify to create customizable user interfaces, and looked at Buefy, which provides a huge collection of UI components to allow us to build our apps rapidly.

We then finished up by providing an introduction to and contrast between input and value validation using Vuelidate and VeeValidate, respectively, and finally, explained how we can use Cleave.js to create smarter interfaces to help our users understand what our app expects.

In the next chapter, we will look at middleware pieces that will form the bridge between the frontend and the backend.
