# Dockerizing an Application

In this chapter, we will learn about Docker and how to package applications as Docker images. Understanding how to package your application as a Docker image will allow you to deploy the application in any kind of environment and infrastructure without having to worry about setting up the infrastructure to build your application. Building a Docker image will allow you to run your application anywhere you like: build once and deploy anywhere.

In this chapter, we will learn about the following key topics:

-   Building a Docker image
-   Running a Docker image
-   Creating a Docker image from scratch
-   Understanding the Docker image filesystem
-   Looking at Docker Compose

# Installing Docker

Docker is an open source platform that is used for software development, making it easy to package and ship programs. Docker enables you to package your application and run it in different kinds of infrastructure such as cloud environments.

In this section, we will look at installing Docker on a local machine. Different operating systems have different steps for installing it. Refer to the Docker documentation for an in-depth installation guide relevant to your operating system, which can be found at [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Note

This chapter was written on a Linux machine, so most of the command-line applications that are outlined are only available for Linux.

After taking the steps to install Docker on our development machine, the following are some of the things we do to ensure that everything is working fine.

Use the following commands to check that the Docker engine is running:

```markup
systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running   | grep -i docker && systemctl list-units --type=service --state=active  | grep -i containerd
```

You will see the following output if the engine has been installed correctly:

```markup
  docker.service                     loaded    active running Docker Application Container Engine
  containerd.service             loaded    active running containerd container runtime
```

The output shows two different services running – `docker.service` and `containerd.service`. The `containerd.service` service takes care of launching the Docker image into a container and ensuring that all the local machine services are set up to allow the container to run while the `docker.service` service takes care of the management of the image and communication with the Docker command-line tools.

Now that we know both services are running, let’s use the command-line tools to check the communication with the engine. Use the following command to communicate with the engine to list all the locally available images – note you may need to have root privileges to do this so prefixing with `sudo` might be required:

```markup
docker images
```

In our case, we get the output as shown in _Figure 13__.1_, showing we have downloaded two images. In your case, if this is your first time installing Docker, it will be empty.

Figure 13.1: Docker images on a local machine

We have successfully completed the Docker installation on the local machine. In the next section, we will go into more detail about using Docker and understanding Docker images.

# Using Docker

In this section, we will look at how to use Docker for day-to-day operations. Let’s understand the concepts that are talked about when using Docker – images and the container:

-   **Docker image**: This image is a file that contains our application, including all the relevant operating system files.
-   **Container**: The image file is read and executed by the Docker engine. Once it runs on the local machine it is called a container. You can interact with the container using the Docker command-line tools.

We will look at using Docker to download and run a simple _Hello World_ application using the following command:

```markup
docker run hello-world
```

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```markup
$ docker run hello-world
```

This command will download the image file (if none exists locally) and execute it. You will then see the following message:

```markup
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
2db29710123e: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:10d7d58d5ebd2a652f4d93fdd86da8f265f5318c6a73cc5b 6a9798ff6d2b2e67
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
```

Once the image has been downloaded and run as a container, it will print out the following output:

```markup
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.

```

Now that we have had a taste of how to run an image file as a container, we will explore Docker images more in the next section.

# Docker images

Docker image files look like any other file on your local machine, except they are stored in a special format that can only be understood by Docker. Locally the image files are stored inside the `/var/lib/docker/image/overlay2` directory. To see what images are available, you can take a look at the `repositories.json` file, which looks as follows:

```markup
{
  "Repositories": {
    "hello-world": {
      "hello-world:latest":
        "sha256:feb5d9fea6a5e9606aa995e879d862b82
         5965ba48de054caab5ef356dc6b3412",
      "hello-world@sha256:

         "sha256:feb5d9fea6a5e9606aa995e879d862

    },
    "...
    "redis": {
      "redis:latest":
        "sha256:bba24acba395b778d9522a1adf5f0d6bba3e609
         4b2d298e71ab08828b880a01b",
      "redis@sha256:69a3ab2516b560690e37197b71bc61ba24
                    5aafe4525ebdec
       e1d8a0bc5669e3e2":
         "sha256:bba24acba395b778d9522a1adf5f0d6bba3
          e6094b2d298e71ab08828b880a01b"
    }
  }
}
```

Let’s explore the Docker directories that host the image files further. We can get the image information using the following command:

```markup
docker images
```

The following output shows some information about the `hello-world` container:

```markup
REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID           CREATED           SIZE
..
hello-world      latest    feb5d9fea6a5   7 months ago   13.3kB
..
```

The image ID for `hello-world` is `feb5d9fea6a5`. Let's try to find the image file inside `/var/lib/docker` using the following command:

```markup
sudo find /var/lib/docker -name 'feb5d9fea6a5*'
```

We will get the following output:

```markup
/var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/imagedb/content/sha256/feb5d9fea 6a5e9606aa995e879d862b825965ba48de054caab5ef356dc6b3412
```

Let's now look inside that file using the following command:

```markup
sudo cat /var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/imagedb/content/sha256/feb5d9fea6a5e9606aa995e879d862b825965ba48de054caab5ef356dc6b3412
```

You will see the following output:

```markup

  "config": {

      …
    "Cmd": [

    ]
  }
}
```

The following table outlines the meanings of some relevant fields from the preceding JSON output:

The JSON information we saw previously can also be viewed using the following command:

```markup
docker image inspect hello-world:latest
```

You will get output that looks as follows:

```markup

                   889defed757d9/work"
            },
            "Name": "overlay2"
        },
                    …]
```

One of the interesting pieces of information in the output is the `GraphDriver` field that points to the `/var/lib/docker/overlay2/c0d9b295437abcdeb9caeec51dcbde1b11b` `0aeb3dd9e469f357889defed757d9` directory containing the extracted Docker image. For hello-world, it will be the `hello` executable file, as shown next:

```markup
total 16
drwx--x---  3 root root 4096 Apr 30 18:36 ./
drwx--x--- 30 root root 4096 Apr 30 19:21 ../
-rw-------  1 root root    0 Apr 30 19:21 committed
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Apr 30 18:36 diff/
-rw-r--r--  1 root root   26 Apr 30 18:36 link
```

Taking a look inside the `diff/` directory, we see the following executable file:

```markup
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  4096 Apr 30 18:36 .
drwx--x--- 3 root root  4096 Apr 30 18:36 ..
-rwxrwxr-x 1 root root 13256 Sep 24  2021 hello
```

Now that we have a good understanding of how Docker images are stored locally, in the next section, we will look at using Docker to run the image locally as a container.

# Running images as containers

In this section, we will look at running Docker images as containers and examine the different information that we can see when a container is running.

Start by running a database Docker image and look at what information we can get about the state of the container. Open the terminal window and run the following command to run Redis locally. Redis is an open source memory-based data store used to store data. Since data is stored in memory, it is fast compared to storing on disk. The command will run Redis, listening on port `7777`:

```markup
docker run -p 7777:7777  -v /home/user/Downloads/redis-7.0-rc3/data:/data redis --port 7777
```

Make sure you change the `/home/user/Downloads/redis-7.0-rc3/data` directory to your own local directory, as Docker will use this to store the Redis data file.

You will see the following message when the container is up and running:

```markup
1:C 05 May 2022 11:20:08.723 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo
1:C 05 May 2022 11:20:08.723 # Redis version=6.2.6, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=1, just started
1:C 05 May 2022 11:20:08.723 # Configuration loaded
1:M 05 May 2022 11:20:08.724 * monotonic clock: POSIX clock_gettime
1:M 05 May 2022 11:20:08.724 * Running mode=standalone, port=7777.
…
1:M 05 May 2022 11:20:08.724 * Ready to accept connections
```

Let’s use the Docker command-line tool to look at the running state of this container. In order to do that, we need to get the ID of the container by running the `docker ps` command; in our case, the output looks as follows:

```markup
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE      COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                                                 NAMES
e1f58f395d06   redis      "docker-entrypoint.s…"   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes   6379/tcp, 0.0.0.0:7777->7777/tcp, :::7777->7777/tcp   reverent_dhawan
```

The Redis container ID is `e1f58f395d06`. Using this information, we will use `docker inspect` to look at the different properties of the running container. Use `docker inspect` as follows:

```markup
docker inspect e1f58f395d06
```

You will get output that looks like the following:

```markup
[[
    {
        ...
        "Mounts": [
            {
                "Type": "bind",
                "Source": "/home/user/Downloads/redis-7.0-
                           rc3/data",
                "Destination": "/data",
                "Mode": "",
                "RW": true,
                "Propagation": "rprivate"
            }
        ],
        "Config": {
            ...
            "Env": [
                "PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:
                      /usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin",
                "GOSU_VERSION=1.14",
                ...
            ],
            ...
        },
        "NetworkSettings": {
            ...
            "Ports": {
                "6379/tcp": null,
                "7777/tcp": [
                    {
                        "HostIp": "0.0.0.0",
                        "HostPort": "7777"
                    },
                    {
                        "HostIp": "::",
                        "HostPort": "7777"
                    }
                ]
            },
            ...
            "Networks": {
                "bridge": {
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
]
```

The output shows a lot of information about the running state of the Redis container. The main things that we are interested in are the network and the mount. The `NetworkSettings` section shows the network configuration of the container, indicating the network mapping parameter of the host to the container – the container is using port `7777`, and the same port is exposed on the local machine.

The other interesting thing is the `Mounts` parameter, which points to the mapping of `/home/user/Downloads/redis-7.0-rc3/data` to the `/data` local host directory inside the container. The mount is like a redirection from the container directory to the local machine directory. Using the mount ensures that all data is saved to the local machine when the container shuts down.

We have seen what a container is all about and how to look at the running state of the container. Now that we have a good understanding of images and containers, we will look at creating our own image in the next section.

# Building and packaging images

In the previous section, we learned about Docker images and how to look at the state of a running container; we also looked at how Docker images are stored locally. In this section, we will look at how to create our own Docker image by writing a `Dockerfile`.

We will look at building the sample application inside the `chapter13/embed` folder. The sample application is the same one we discussed in [_Chapter 4_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor053)_, Serving and Embedding HTML Content_. The application will run an HTTP server listening on port `3333` to serve an embedded HTML page.

The `Dockerfile` that we will use to build the Docker image looks as follows:

```markup
# 1. Compile the app.
FROM golang:1.18  as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -o bin/embed
# 2. Create final environment for the compiled binary.
FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --update upgrade && apk --no-cache add curl ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
RUN mkdir -p /app
# 3. Copy the binary from step 1 and set it as the default command.
COPY --from=builder /app/bin/embed /app
WORKDIR /app
CMD /app/embed
```

Let’s step through the different parts of the command to understand what it is doing. The first step is to compile the application by using a pre-built Golang 1.18 Docker image. This image contains all the necessary tools to build a Go application. We specify `/app` as the working directory using the `WORKDIR` command, and in the last line we copy all the source files using the `COPY` command and compile the source code using the standard `go build` command line.

```markup
FROM golang:1.18  as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -o bin/embed
```

After successfully compiling the application, the next step is to prepare the runtime environment that will host the application. In this case, we are using a pre-built Docker image of the Alpine Linux operating system. Alpine is a Linux distribution that is small in terms of size, which makes it ideal when creating Docker images for applications to run on.

The next thing we want to do is to make sure the operating system is up to date by using the - `update upgrade` command. This ensures that the operating system contains all the latest updates, including security updates. The last step is to create a new `/app` directory that will store the application binary:

```markup
FROM alpine:latest
RUN apk --update upgrade && apk --no-cache add curl ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*
RUN mkdir -p /app
```

The final step is to copy over the binary from the previous step, which we have labeled as `builder`, into the new `/app` directory. The `CMD` command specifies the command that will be run when the Docker image is executed as a container – in this case, we want to run our sample application `embed` specified by the parameter `/app/embed`:

```markup
COPY --from=builder /app/bin/embed /app
WORKDIR /app
CMD /app/embed
```

Now we have gone through what the `Dockerfile` is doing, let’s create the Docker image. Use the following command to build the image:

```markup
docker build  --tag chapter13 .
```

You will see an output that looks like the following, showing the different steps and processes Docker is doing to build the image:

```markup
Sending build context to Docker daemon   29.7kB
Step 1/10 : FROM golang:1.18  as builder
 ---> 65b2f1fa535f
Step 2/10 : WORKDIR /app
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 7ab996f8148c
…
Step 5/10 : FROM alpine:latest
 ---> 0ac33e5f5afa
…
Step 8/10 : COPY --from=builder /app/bin/embed /app
…
Step 10/10 : CMD /app/embed
 ---> Using cache
 ---> ade99a01b92e
Successfully built ade99a01b92e
Successfully tagged chapter13:latest
```

Once you get the `Successfully tagged` message, the building process is complete, and the image is ready on your local machine.

The new image will be labeled `chapter13` and will look as follows when we use the `docker` `images` command:

```markup
REPOSITORY    TAG           IMAGE ID       CREATED             SIZE
…
chapter13     latest        ade99a01b92e   33 minutes ago      16.9MB
…
golang        1.18          65b2f1fa535f   14 hours ago        964MB
…
hello-world   latest        feb5d9fea6a5   7 months ago        13.3kB
```

Run the newly created image using the following command:

```markup
docker  run -p 3333:3333 chapter13
```

The command will run the image as a container, and using the `-p` port parameter, it exposes port `3333` inside the container to the same port `3333` on the host. Open your browser and type in `http://localhost:3333` and you will see the HTML login page, as shown in _Figure 13__.2_:

In the next section, we’ll understand about Docker Compose.

# Docker Compose

Docker provides another tool called Docker Compose, allowing developers to run multiple containers simultaneously. Think about use cases where you are building a server that requires temporary memory storage to store cart information; this requires using an external application such as Redis, which provides an in-memory database.

In this kind of scenario, our application depends on Redis to function properly, which means that we need to run Redis at the same time we run our application. There are many other different kinds of use cases where there will be a need to use Docker Compose. The Docker Compose documentation provides a complete step-by-step guide on how to install it on your local machine: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Docker Compose is actually a file that outlines the different containers we want to use. Let’s try to run the sample Docker Compose file that is inside the `chapter13/embed` folder. Open the terminal and make sure you are inside the `chapter13/embed` folder, then execute the following command:

```markup
docker compose -f compose.yaml up
```

You will get the following output:

Once everything is running, you should be able to access the server by opening your browser and typing `http://localhost:3333` in the address bar.

The Docker Compose file looks as follows:

```markup
version: '3'
services:
 server:
   build: .
   ports:
     - "3333:3333"
 cache:z
   image: redis:7.0.4-alpine
   restart: always
   ports:
     - '6379:6379'
```

The file outlines two containers that need to be run – the server is pointing to our application server, and the `build` parameter uses the `.` dot notation. This tells Docker Compose that the source (Dockerfile) to build the image for this container is found in the local directory, while the cache service is a Redis server, and it will be pulled from the Docker remote registry, specifically version 7.0.4.

# Summary

In this chapter, we learned about what Docker is and how to use it. Building applications is one part of the puzzle, but packaging them to be deployed in a cloud environment requires developers to understand Docker and how to build Docker images for their applications. We looked at how Docker stores images on your local machine and also inspected the state of the running container.

We learned that when containers are running, there is a lot of information generated that can help us to understand what’s going on with the container and also the parameters used to run our application. We also learned about the `Dockerfile` and used it to package our sample application into a container to run it as a single Docker image.

In the next chapter, we will use the knowledge we gained in this chapter by deploying our images to a cloud environment.
