# Securing the Backend and Middleware

In previous chapters, we learned how to build our database, run our web application as a server, and serve dynamic content. In this chapter, we will discuss security – in particular, we will look at securing the web app. Security is a vast topic so for this chapter, we will just look at the security aspects that are relevant to our application. Another topic that we will look at is middleware and using it as part of our application.

Middleware is software that is introduced into an application to provide generic functionality that is used for incoming and outgoing traffic in our application. Middleware makes it easy to centralize features that are used across different parts of our applications, and this will be discussed more in upcoming sections of this chapter.

In this chapter, we’ll be covering the following topics:

-   Adding authentication
-   Adding middleware
-   Adding cookies and sessions with Redis

Upon completing this chapter, you will have learned how to set up a user database and add authentication to the app. We will also learn about middleware and how to add it to an existing app. Lastly, you will learn about cookies, storing information in sessions, and using Redis as persistence storage for these sessions.

# Adding authentication

Building the application requires some consideration in terms of designing the application, and one of the key pieces that needs to be thought of ahead of time is security. There are many facets of security but in this section of our application, we will look at authentication.

Note

Authentication is the process of validating that a user is who they claim to be.

To add authentication to our app, we will need to store the user information in the database first. The user information will be used to authenticate the user before using the application. The database user table can be found inside the `db/schema.sql` file:

```markup
CREATE TABLE gowebapp.users (
User_ID        BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
User_Name      text NOT NULL,
Password_Hash text NOT NULL,
Name           text NOT NULL,
Config         JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::JSONB NOT NULL,
Created_At     TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
Is_Enabled     BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE NOT NULL
```

The following table outlines the data types that are used for the user table:

<table id="table001-4" class="No-Table-Style"><colgroup><col> <col></colgroup><tbody><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">BIGSERIAL</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>An auto-incrementing data type that is normally used as a primary key.</p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">TEXT</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>A variable-length <span class="No-Break">character string.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">JSONB</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>The JSON binary data type is suitable for JSON data. The database provides this data type to make it easier to index, parse, and query JSON <span class="No-Break">data directly.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">TIMESTAMP</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>A date and time <span class="No-Break">data type.</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">BOOLEAN</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>A logical data type that contains true <span class="No-Break">or false.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The authentication will be performed by checking the `User_Name` and `Pass_Word_Hash` fields. One thing to note – the `Pass_Word_Hash` field contains an encrypted password, and we will look further into encrypting the password a bit later.

As discussed in [_Chapter 1_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016), _Building the Database and Model_, we are using sqlc to generate the Go code that will talk to the database. To generate the Go code, execute the following command:

```markup
make generate
```

The code that will read the user information will be stored under the `gen/query.sql_gen.go` file as shown here:

```markup
...
func (q *Queries) GetUserByName(ctx context.Context, userName string) (GowebappUser, error) {
  row := q.db.QueryRowContext(ctx, getUserByName, userName)
  var i GowebappUser
  err := row.Scan(
     &i.UserID,
     &i.UserName,
     &i.PasswordHash,
     &i.Name,
     &i.Config,
     &i.CreatedAt,
     &i.IsEnabled,
  )
  return i, err
}
...
```

The `GetUserByName` function queries the database by calling the `QueryRowContext()` function, passing in the query that we want to use, which is defined as shown here:

```markup
const getUserByName = `-- name: GetUserByName :one
SELECT user_id, user_name, pass_word_hash, name, config, created_at, is_enabled
FROM gowebapp.users
WHERE user_name = $1
`
```

The query uses the `WHERE` clause and expects one parameter, which is the `user_name` field. This is populated by passing the `userName` parameter into the `QueryRowContext()` function.

We will look at how to create a dummy user when we start the application in the next section. A dummy user is a user that is normally used for testing purposes – in our case, we want to create a dummy user to test the authentication process.

## Creating our dummy user

Our database is empty so we will need to populate it with a dummy user and in this section, we will look at how to create one. We will add code to create a dummy user when the application starts up. The following function inside `main.go` creates the dummy user, and this user will be used to log in to the application:

```markup
func createUserDb(ctx context.Context) {
  //has the user been created
  u, _ := dbQuery.GetUserByName(ctx, "user@user")
  if u.UserName == "user@user" {
     log.Println("user@user exist...")
     return
  }
  log.Println("Creating user@user...")
  hashPwd, _ := pkg.HashPassword("password")
  _, err := dbQuery.CreateUsers(ctx,
                                chapter5.CreateUsersParams{
     UserName:     "user@user",
     PassWordHash: hashPwd,
     Name:         "Dummy user",
  })
...
}
```

When the application starts up it will first check whether an existing test user exists and if none exists, it will automatically create one. This is put inside the application to make it easier for us to test the application. The `createUserDb()` function uses the `CreateUsers()` generated sqlc function to create the user.

One of the things you will notice is the password is created by the following code snippet:

```markup
hashPwd, _ := pkg.HashPassword("password")
```

The password is passed to a `HashPassword` function that will return a hashed version of the clear text password.

The `HashPassword` function uses the Go `crypto` or `bcrypt` standard libraries that provide a function to return a hash of a plain string as shown here:

```markup
func HashPassword(password string) (string, error) {
  bytes, err := 
    bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword([]byte(password), 14)
  return string(bytes), err
}
```

The hash generated from the string password will be different whenever the `bcrypt.GenerateFromPassword` function is called. The `GenerateFromPassword()` function uses the standard cryptography library to generate the hash value of the password.

Cryptography is the practice of ensuring text messages are converted into a form that is not easy to read or deconstruct. This provides data security to make it hard to deconstruct what the data is all about. Go provides a standard library that provides cryptography functions, which is available in the `golang.org/x/crypto` package. The `crypto` library provides a number of cryptography functions that you can choose from – it all depends on what you need for your application. In our example, we use `bcrypt`, which is a password-hashing function.

Now that we have added a function to create a dummy user in the database, in the next section, we will look at how to authenticate with the database.

## Authenticating a user

User authentication is simple, as the application will use the function generated by sqlc, as shown here:

```markup
func validateUser(username string, password string) bool {
  ...
  u, _ := dbQuery.GetUserByName(ctx, username)
  ...
  return pkg.CheckPasswordHash(password, u.PassWordHash)
}
```

The `GetUserByName` function is used, with the username passed as a parameter to obtain the user information. Once that has been retrieved successfully, it will check whether the password is correct by calling `CheckPasswordHash`.

The `CheckPasswordHash` function uses the same `crypto` or `bcrypt` package and it calls the `CompareHashAndPassword` function, which will compare the hashed password with the password sent by the client. The function returns `true` if the password matches.

```markup
func CheckPasswordHash(password, hash string) bool {
  err := bcrypt.CompareHashAndPassword([]byte(hash), 
                                       []byte(password))
return err == nil
}
```

The `validateUser` function will return `true` if the username and password combination exists in the database and is correct.

Start your application and navigate your web browser to `http://127.0.0.1:3333/` and you should see a login prompt. Try logging in with incorrect credentials before entering `user@user / password` – you should now be sent to the successful login screen! Congratulations – you successfully authenticated!

In the next section, we will look at middleware, what it is, and how to add it to our application.

# Adding middleware

Middleware is a piece of code that is configured as an HTTP handler. The middleware will pre-process and post-process the request, and it sits between the main Go server and the actual HTTP handlers that have been declared.

Adding middleware as part of our application helps take care of tasks that are outside of the main application features. Middleware can take care of authentication, logging, and rate limiting, among other things. In the next section, we will look at adding a simple logging middleware.

## Basic middleware

In this section, we are going to add a simple basic middleware to our application. The basic middleware is shown in the following code snippet:

```markup
func basicMiddleware(h http.Handler) http.Handler {
   return http.HandlerFunc(func(wr http.ResponseWriter,
                                   req *http.Request) {
       log.Println("Middleware called on", req.URL.Path)
       // do stuff
       h.ServeHTTP(wr, req)
   })
}
```

Gorilla Mux makes it incredibly easy to use our middleware. This is done by exposing a function on the router called `Use()`, which is implemented with a variadic number of parameters that can be used to stack multiple pieces of middleware to be executed in order:

```markup
func (*mux.Router).Use(mwf ...mux.MiddlewareFunc)
```

The following code snippet shows how we implement the `Use()` function to register the middleware:

```markup
func main() {
    ...
    // Use our basicMiddleware
    router.Use(basicMiddleware)
    ...
}
```

`mux.MiddwareFunc` is simply a type alias for `func(http.Handler) http.Handler` so that anything that meets that interface can work.

To see our function in action, we simply call `router.Use()`, pass in our middleware, navigate to our web app, and there we can see that it is called:

```markup
go build && ./chapter5 
2022/01/24 19:51:56 Server Version : 0.0.2
2022/01/24 19:51:56 user@user exists...
2022/01/24 19:52:02 Middleware called on /app
2022/01/24 19:52:02 Middleware called on /css/minified.css
…
```

You may be wondering why you can see it being called multiple times with different paths – the reason is that when requesting our app, it’s performing a number of `GET` requests for the numerous hosted resources. Each of these is passing through our middleware as shown in _Figure 5__.1_:

![Figure 5.1 – Request passing through middleware](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_5.01_B18295.jpg)

Figure 5.1 – Request passing through middleware

The `handlers` library – available at [https://github.com/gorilla/handlers](https://github.com/gorilla/handlers) – contains many other useful middleware methods and we’ll be using some of them later, including the `handlers.CORS()` middleware to allow us to handle **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** (**CORS**). We will look at CORS and using this middleware in more detail in [_Chapter 9_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor184), _Tailwind, Middleware,_ _and CORS._

In this section, we learned about middleware, the different functionality that it can provide, and how to add it to an app. In the next section, we will look at session handling and using cookies to track user information as they use the application.

# Adding cookies and sessions

In this section, we are going to take a look at how we are going to keep track of the users when using our application. We are going to take a look at session management and how it can help our application understand whether a user is allowed to access our application. We are also going to take a look at cookies, which are a session management tool that we are going to use.

The session management discussed in this chapter is part of the Gorilla project, which can be found at [https://github.com/gorilla/sessions](https://github.com/gorilla/sessions).

## Cookies and session handling

In this section, we are going to look at session handling and how to use it to store information relevant to a particular user. The web as we know is stateless in nature, which means that requests are not actually tied to any other previous requests. This makes it hard to know which requests belong to which user. Hence, the need arises to keep track of this and store information about the user.

Note

A web session is used to facilitate interaction between users and the different services that are used in the sequence of requests and responses. The session is unique to a particular user.

Sessions are stored in memory, with each session belonging to a particular user. Session information will be lost if the application stops running or when the application decides to remove the session information. There are different ways to store session information permanently in storage to be used at a future time.

_Figure 5__.2_ shows the high-level flow of how a session is created and used for each incoming request. New sessions are created when one does not exist and once one is made available, the application can use it to store relevant user information.

![Figure 5.2 – Session check flow](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_5.02_B18295.jpg)

Figure 5.2 – Session check flow

We know that a session is used to store user-specific information – the question is how the application knows which session to use for which user. The answer is a key that is sent back and forth between the application and the browser. This key is called a session key, which is added to the cookie header as shown in _Figure 5__.3_.

![Figure 5.3 – Cookie containing a session token](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_5.03_B18295.jpg)

Figure 5.3 – Cookie containing a session token

As seen in _Figure 5__.3_, the cookie with the `session_token` label contains the key that will be sent back to the server to identify the user stored in the session. _Figure 5__.3_ shows the developer console of the browser. For Firefox, you can open it using the **Tools** > **Web Developer** > **Web Developer Tool** menu, and if you are using Chrome, you can access it using _Ctrl_ + _Shift_ + _J_.

The following snippet shows the `sessionValid` function, which checks whether the incoming request contains a valid `session_token` key. The `store.Get` function will automatically create a new one if an existing session is not available for the current user:

```markup
//sessionValid check whether the session is a valid session
func sessionValid(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) bool {
  session, _ := store.Get(r, "session_token")
  return !session.IsNew
}
```

Once the application finds a session for the user, it will check the authentication status of the user as shown here. The session information is stored as a map, and the map type stores information as key and value, so in our case, we are checking whether the session contains the `authenticated` key:

```markup
func hasBeenAuthenticated(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) bool {
  session, _ := store.Get(r, "session_token")
  a, _ := session.Values["authenticated"]
  ...
}
```

If there is a failure to obtain the `authenticated` key, the application will automatically redirect the request to display the login page as shown here:

```markup
//if it does have a valid session make sure it has been //authenticated
if hasBeenAuthenticated(w, r) {
  ...
}
//otherwise it will need to be redirected to /login
...
http.Redirect(w, r, "/login", 307)
```

We have learned about sessions and how we can use them to check whether a user has been authenticated. We will explore this further.

## Storing session information

In the previous section, we learned about sessions and cookie handling. In this section, we will look at how to store session information pertaining to the user. The information stored inside the session is stored in the server memory, which means that this data will be temporarily available as long as the server is still running. Once the server stops running, all the data stored in memory will not available anymore. This is why we will look at persisting the data in a separate storage system in the next section.

In our sample application, we are storing information on whether the user has been authenticated successfully. Users are allowed to access other parts of the application only when they have been successfully authenticated.

Run the sample application and open your browser in private mode (Firefox) or incognito mode (Chrome) and type `http://localhost:3333/dashboard.html` as the address. The application will redirect you to the login page because the session does not exist. The operation to check for the existence of the `authenticated` key is performed inside the `storeAuthenticated` function shown here:

```markup
func storeAuthenticated(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, v bool) {
  session, _ := store.Get(r, "session_token")
  session.Values["authenticated"] = v
  err := session.Save(r, w)
  ...
}
```

The `session.Save` function saves the session into memory after creating the `authenticated` key with a new value pass as part of the function call.

## Using Redis for a session

As discussed in the previous section, the sessions are stored in memory. In this section, we will look at storing the session information permanently using Redis. The code samples for this section can be found at [https://github.com/ImagineDevOps DevOps/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Go/tree/main/Chapter05-redis](https://github.com/ImagineDevOps DevOps/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Go/tree/main/Chapter05-redis).

The reason why we want to use Redis is because of its simplicity in terms of data storage, only containing key values. It also can be configured for both in-memory and permanent external storage. For our application, we will need to configure `redis` to store information on the disk to make it permanent. Execute the following `make` command to run `redis`:

```markup
make redis
```

The following is the full Docker command used to run `redis`:

```markup
docker run -v $(PWD)/redisdata:/data --name local-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis --loglevel verbose
```

The command runs `redis` using Docker and specifies the `redisdata` local directory as the location of the permanent file storage for the data. To run the sample application, make sure you also run `postgres` using this command:

```markup
make teardown_recreate
```

Once both `redis` and `postgres` are up and running, you can now run the sample app and use the web application. The following code snippet shows the `initRedis()` function, which takes care of initializing Redis. The function uses two different packages, which you can find at [https://github.com/redis/go-redis](https://github.com/redis/go-redis) and [https://github.com/rbcervilla/redisstore](https://github.com/rbcervilla/redisstore). The `go-redis/redis` package contains the driver and API to communicate with Redis while `rbcervilla/redisstore` contains a simple API to read, write, and delete data from Redis:

```markup
func initRedis() {
  var err error
  client = redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{
     Addr: "localhost:6379",
  })
  store, err = rstore.NewRedisStore(context.Background(), 
                                    client)
  if err != nil {
     log.Fatal("failed to create redis store: ", err)
  }
  store.KeyPrefix("session_token")
}
```

Once the initialization has been completed, the `store` variable will be used to write data to and read it from Redis. Inside the `gorilla` library, the `sessions` package automatically uses the configured `client` object to handle all writing and reading of information to and from `redis`.

A new additional handler is added to allow the user to log out from the application as shown in the handler snippet here:

```markup
func logoutHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  if hasBeenAuthenticated(w, r) {
     session, _ := store.Get(r, "session_token")
     session.Options.MaxAge = -1
     err := session.Save(r, w)
     if err != nil {
        log.Println("failed to delete session", err)
}
  }
  http.Redirect(w, r, "/login", 307)
}
```

The logout operation is done by setting the `Options.MaxAge` field for a session. This indicates to the library that the next time the same `session_token` is passed to the server, it is considered an invalid/expired session and it will redirect to the login page.

# Summary

In this chapter, we learned about a few new things that can help our application better. We learned how to add an authentication layer to our application to secure it, which helps protect our application from being accessed anonymously. We also looked at adding middleware to our application and showed how easy it was to add different middleware to our application without changing much code.

Lastly, we looked at session handling and learned how to use it to track user information and a user’s journey with our application. Since session handling is not stored permanently, we looked at using the `redis` data store to store the user session information, which allows the application to remember user information anytime the application is restarted.

In the next chapter, we will look at writing code that will process information back and forth between the browser and our application. We will look at building a REST API that will be used to perform different operations on our data.
