# Application Logging

Building any kind of application to fulfill a user’s need is one piece of the puzzle; another piece is figuring out how we are going to design it so that we can support it in case there are issues in production. Logging is one of the most important things that need to be thought about thoroughly to allow some visibility when a problem arises. Application logging is the process of saving application events and errors; put simply, it produces a file that contains information about events that occur in your software application. Supporting applications in production requires a quick turnaround, and to achieve this, sufficient information should be logged by the application.

In this chapter, we will look at building a logging server that will be used to log events (e.g., errors) from our application. We will also learn how to multiplex logging to allow us to log different events based on how we configure it. We will cover the following in this chapter:

# Exploring Go standard logging

In this section, we will look at the default logging library provided by the Go language. Go provides a rich set of libraries; however, like every other library, there are limitations – it does not provide leveled logging (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, etc.), file log file features, and many more. These limitations can be overcome by using open source logging libraries.

Go provides very diverse and rich standard libraries for applications. Logging is one of them, and it is available inside the `log` package. The following documentation link provides complete information on the different functions available inside the [https://pkg.go.dev/log@latest](mailto:https://pkg.go.dev/log@latest) package.

Another package that is available in Go standard library is the `fmt` package, which provides functions for I/O operations such as printing, input, and so on. More information can be found at `https://pkg.go.dev/fmt@latest`. The available functions inside the `log` package are similar to the `fmt` package, and when going through the sample code, we will see that it is super easy to use.

The following are some of the functions provided by the `log` package (`https://pkg.go.dev/log)`:

```markup
func (l *Logger) Fatal(v ...interface{})
func (l *Logger) Fatalf(format string, v ...interface{})
func (l *Logger) Fatalln(v ...interface{})
func (l *Logger) Panic(v ...interface{})
func (l *Logger) Prefix() string
func (l *Logger) Print(v ...interface{})
func (l *Logger) Printf(format string, v ...interface{})
func (l *Logger) Println(v ...interface{})
func (l *Logger) SetFlags(flag int)
func (l *Logger) SetOutput(w io.Writer)
func (l *Logger) SetPrefix(prefix string)
```

Let’s take a look at the example code from the sample repository, [https://github.com/ImagineDevOps DevOps/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Go/tree/main/Chapter02](https://github.com/ImagineDevOps DevOps/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Go/tree/main/Chapter02). The `main.go` file resides inside `example/stdlog`. To understand how to use the `log` package, build and run the code:

```markup
go run .
```

On a successful run, you will get the following output:

```markup
2021/10/15 10:12:38 Just a log text
main.go:38: This is number 1
10:12:38 {
        «name»: «Cake»,
        «batters»: {
                «batter»: [
                        {
                                «id»: «001»,
                                «type»: «Good Food»
                        }
                ]
        },
        «topping»: [
                {
                        «id»: «002»,
                        «type»: «Syrup»
                }
        ]
}
```

The output shows that the standard logging library is configurable to allow different log output formats – for example, you can see in the following that the message is prefixed with the formatted date and time:

```markup
2021/10/15 10:12:38 Just a log text
```

The function that takes care of formatting the prefix for logging is the `SetFlags(..)` function:

```markup
func main() {
  ...
  // set log format to - dd/mm/yy hh:mm:ss
  ol.SetFlags(log.LstdFlags)
  ol.Println(«Just a log text»)
  ...
}
```

The code sets the flag to use `LstdFlags`, which is a combination of date and time. The following table shows the different flags that can be used:

<table id="table001-2" class="No-Table-Style"><colgroup><col> <col></colgroup><tbody><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Flag</strong></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Explanation</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">Ldate</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>A flag to specify the date in the local time zone in the <span class="No-Break">format YYYY/MM/DD</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">Ltime</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>A flag to specify time using the local time zone in the <span class="No-Break">format HH:MM:SS</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">Lmicroseconds</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>A flag to specify <span class="No-Break">in microseconds</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">Llongfile</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>A flag to specify the filename and <span class="No-Break">line number</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">Lshortfile</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>The final filename element and <span class="No-Break">line number</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">LUTC</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>When using the <code class="literal">Ldate</code> or <code class="literal">Ltime</code> flag, we can use this flag to specify using UTC instead of the local <span class="No-Break">time zone</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">Lmsgprefix</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>A flag to specify the prefix text to be shown before <span class="No-Break">the message</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">LstdFlags</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>This flag uses the standard flag that has been defined, which is basically <code class="literal">Ldate</code> <span class="No-Break">or </span><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">Ltime</code></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The standard library can cover some use cases for application log requirements, but there are times when applications require more features that are not available from the standard library – for example, sending log information to multiple outputs will require extra functionality to be built, or in another scenario, you might need to convert nested error logs into JSON format. In the next section, we will explore another alternative for our sample application.

# Using golog

Now that we understand what is available in the standard library, we want to explore the option of using a library that can provide us with more flexibility. We will look at the `golog` open source project ([https://github.com/kataras/golog](https://github.com/kataras/golog)). The `golog` library is a dependency-free logging library that provides functionality such as leveled logging (`INFO`, `ERROR`, etc.), JSON-based output, and configurable color output.

One of the most used features of logging is log levels, also known as leveled logging. Log levels are used to categorize output information from an application into different severity levels. The following table shows the different severity levels:

<table id="table002-1" class="No-Table-Style"><colgroup><col> <col></colgroup><tbody><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">INFO</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>Just for <span class="No-Break">information purposes</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">WARN</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>Something is not running correctly, so keep an eye out for it in case there are more <span class="No-Break">severe errors</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">ERROR</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>There is an error that will need <span class="No-Break">some attention</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">DEBUG</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>Information that is important to assist in troubleshooting in production, or added into the application for <span class="No-Break">tracing purposes</span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">FATAL</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p>Something bad happened in the application that <span class="No-Break">requires immediate</span> <span class="No-Break">response/investigation</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Example code can be found inside the `example/golog` directory. Build and run the code, and you will get the following output:

![Figure 2.1 – Example of golog output](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_2.1_B18295.jpg)

Figure 2.1 – Example of golog output

Each prefix of the log messages is of a different color, which corresponds to the different severity levels; this is useful when you are going through a long list of log messages. Different log levels are assigned different colors to make it easy to go through them.

The code to generate this log is similar to the standard library code, as shown here:

```markup
func main() {
  golog.SetLevel(«error»)
  golog.Println(«This is a raw message, no levels, no
                 colors.»)
  golog.Info(«This is an info message, with colors (if the
              output is terminal)»)
  golog.Warn(«This is a warning message»)
  golog.Error(«This is an error message»)
  golog.Debug(«This is a debug message»)
  golog.Fatal(`Fatal will exit no matter what,
              but it will also print the log message if
              logger›s Level is >=FatalLevel`)
}
```

The library provides level-based logging. This means that the library can show log messages based on what is configured to be shown; for example, for development, we want to configure the logger to show all log messages, while in production, we want to show only error messages. The following table shows what the output will look like when different levels are configured for `golog`:

<table id="table003-1" class="No-Table-Style"><colgroup><col> <col></colgroup><tbody><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Level</strong></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Output</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">golog.SetLevel("info")</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><code class="literal">2021/10/15 12:07 This is a raw message, no levels, </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">no colors.</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[INFO] 2021/10/15 12:07 This is an info message, with colors (if the output </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">is terminal)</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[WARN] 2021/10/15 12:07 This is a </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">warning message</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[ERRO] 2021/10/15 12:07 This is an </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">error message</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[FTAL] 2021/10/15 12:07 Fatal will exit no </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">matter what</code></span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">golog.SetLevel("debug")</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><code class="literal">2021/10/15 12:08 This is a raw message, no levels, </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">no colors.</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[INFO] 2021/10/15 12:08 This is an info message, with colors (if the output </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">is terminal)</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[WARN] 2021/10/15 12:08 This is a </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">warning message</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[ERRO] 2021/10/15 12:08 This is an </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">error message</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[DBUG] 2021/10/15 12:08 This is a </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">debug message</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[FTAL] 2021/10/15 12:08 Fatal will exit no </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">matter what</code></span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">golog.SetLevel("warn")</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><code class="literal">2021/10/15 12:08 This is a raw message, no levels, </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">no colors.</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[WARN] 2021/10/15 12:08 This is a </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">warning message</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[ERRO] 2021/10/15 12:08 This is an </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">error message</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[FTAL] 2021/10/15 12:08 Fatal will exit no </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">matter what</code></span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">golog.SetLevel("error")</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><code class="literal">2021/10/15 12:11 This is a raw message, no levels, </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">no colors.</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[ERRO] 2021/10/15 12:11 This is an </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">error message</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[FTAL] 2021/10/15 12:11 Fatal will exit no </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">matter what</code></span></p></td></tr><tr class="No-Table-Style"><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">golog.SetLevel("fatal")</code></span></p></td><td class="No-Table-Style"><p><code class="literal">2021/10/15 12:11 This is a raw message, no levels, </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">no colors.</code></span></p><p><code class="literal">[FTAL] 2021/10/15 12:11 Fatal will exit no </code><span class="No-Break"><code class="literal">matter what</code></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

We covered golog and its features in this section, and now we have a good understanding of the different options available for us to use for logging. In the next section, we will look at golog a bit more.

# Local logging

Now that we have an idea of how to use golog, we are going to use more of its features to extend it. The library provides a function allowing applications to handle writing the log messages for each log level – for example, an application wants to write all errors into a file while the rest print out into the console.

We are going to take a look at the example code inside the `example/gologmoutput` directory. Build and run it and you will see two new files created called `infoerr.txt` and `infolog.txt`. The output from both files will look as follows:

```markup
[ERRO] 2021/11/26 21:11 This is an error message [INFO] 2021/11/26 21:11 This is an info message, with colors (if the output is terminal)
```

The app uses the `os.OpenFile` standard library to create or append files called `infolog.txt` and `infoerr.txt`, which will contain different log information that is configured using the golog `SetLevelOutput` function. The following is the snippet of the function that configured the different logging output using golog:

```markup
func configureLogger() {
  // open infolog.txt  append if exist (os.O_APPEND) or
  // create if not (os.O_CREATE) and read write
  // (os.O_WRONLY)
  infof, err := os.OpenFile(logFile,
                  os.O_APPEND|os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY,
                  0666)
  ...
  golog.SetLevelOutput(«info», infof)
   // open infoerr.txt  append if exist (os.O_APPEND) or
      create if not (os.O_CREATE) and read write
   // (os.O_WRONLY)
   // errf, err := os.OpenFile(«infoerr.txt»,
                 os.O_APPEND|os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY,
                 0666)
    ...
  golog.SetLevelOutput(«error», errf)
}
```

The rest of the log-level messages are written to `stdout`, which is configured by default by the library.

In this section, we learned how to configure golog to allow us to log errors and information separately. This is super useful as, in production, we will have a hard time if we log everything into a single file. In the next section, we will look at building our own simple logging server to accept log requests from our application.

# Writing log messages to the logging server

In the modern cloud environment, there are multiple instances of the same application running on different servers. Due to the distributed nature of the cloud environment, it will be hard to keep track of the different logs produced by the different application instances. This will require using a centralized logging system that will be able to capture all the different log messages from the different applications and systems.

For our needs, we will build our own logging server to capture all log messages in one single place; the code can be found at [https://github.com/ImagineDevOps DevOps/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Go/tree/main/logserver](https://github.com/ImagineDevOps DevOps/Full-Stack-Web-Development-with-Go/tree/main/logserver). The logging server will be a central place that will collate log information from our application, which will help in troubleshooting when our applications are deployed in a cloud environment. The downside of having a central logging server is that when the logging server goes down, we have no visibility of the logging information except by going to the server that hosts the applications.

**REST** stands for **representational state transfer**; in layman’s terms, it describes a server that uses the HTTP protocol and methods to communicate to resources in the server. Information is delivered in different formats, with JSON being the most popular format. It is language agnostic, which means that the logging server can be used by any application that can send and receive over HTTP.

On a successful build, the logging server will display the following message:

```markup
2021/10/15 23:37:31 Initializing logging server at port 8010
```

Once the logging server is up, go back to the `chapter2` root directory where the sample app resides and test the app by running the following command:

```markup
make build
```

On completion, run the new binary called `sampledb`. The `sampledb` app will send log messages to the logging server:

```markup
"{\n  \"timestamp\": 1634301479,\n  \"level\": \"info\",\n  \"message\": \"Starting the application...\"\n}\n"
"{\n  \"timestamp\": 1634301479,\n  \"level\": \"info\",\n  \"message\": \"Database connection fine\"\n}\n"
"{\n  \"timestamp\": 1634301479,\n  \"level\": \"info\",\n  \"message\": \"Success - user creation\"\n}\n"
"{\n  \"timestamp\": 1634301479,\n  \"level\": \"info\",\n  \"message\": \"Success - exercise creation\"\n}\n"
"{\n  \"timestamp\": 1634301479,\n  \"level\": \"info\",\n  \"message\": \"Application complete\"\n}\n"
"{\n  \"timestamp\": 1634301479,\n  \"level\": \"info\",\n  \"message\": \"Application complete\"\n}\nut\"\n}\n"
```

The logging server runs as a normal HTTP server that listens on port `8010`, registering a single endpoint, `/log`, to accept incoming log messages. Let’s go through it and try to understand how the logging server works. But before that, let’s take a look at how the server code works:

```markup
import (
  ...
  «github.com/gorilla/mux»
  ...
)
func runServer(addr string) {
  router = mux.NewRouter()
  initializeRoutes()
  ...
  log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(addr, router))
}
```

The server is using a framework called Gorilla Mux ([github.com/gorilla/mux](http://github.com/gorilla/mux)), which is responsible for accepting and dispatching incoming requests to their respective handler. The `gorilla/mux` package that we are using for this sample is used actively by the open source community; however, it is, at the moment, looking for a maintainer to continue the project.

The handler that takes care of handling the request is inside `initializeRoutes()`, as shown here:

```markup
func initializeRoutes() {
  router.HandleFunc(«/log», loghandler).Methods(http.    MethodPost)
}
```

The `router.HandleFunc(..)` function configured the `/log` endpoint, which will be handled by the `loghandler` function. `Methods("POST")` is instructing the framework that it should accept only the `POST` HTTP method for incoming requests that hit the `/``log` endpoint.

Now we are going to take a look at the `loghandler` function, which is responsible for processing the incoming log messages:

```markup
func loghandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(r.Body)
  ...
  w.WriteHeader(http.StatusCreated)
}
```

The `http.ResponseWriter` parameter is a type that is defined as an interface to be used to construct an HTTP response – for example, it contains the `WriteHeader` method, which allows writing header into the response. The `http.Request` parameter provides an interface for the function to interact with the request received by the server – for example, it provides a `Referer` function to obtain a referring URL.

The `loghandler` function does the following:

1.  Reads the request body as it contains the log message.
2.  On successful reading of the body, the handler will return HTTP status code `201` (`StatusCreated`). Code `201` means the request has been processed successfully and the resource (in this case, the log JSON message) has been created successfully, or in our case, printed successfully.
3.  Prints out the log message to `stdout`.

For more detailed information about the different standard HTTP status codes, refer to the following website: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

We have learned how to add logs to an application and how to build a simple logging server that can be hosted separately from our application. In the next section, we will create a logging wrapper that will allow our application to choose whether it wants to log locally or log to a server.

# Configuring multiple outputs

Why do we want to configure multiple outputs? Well, it is useful as, during development, it is easier to look at logs locally for troubleshooting purposes, but in production, it’s not possible to look at a log file, as everything will be inside the logging server.

We are going to write a thin layer of wrapper code that will wrap the `golog` library; the code that we are going to look at is inside the `chapter2/` directory, inside the `logger/log.go` file. The benefit of having a wrapper code for the `golog` library is to isolate the application for interfacing directly with the library; this will make it easy to swap to different logging libraries when and if required. The app configured the wrapper code by passing the parsed flag to the `SetLoggingOutput(..)` function.

Build the application by running the following:

```markup
make build
```

Then, run it, passing the flag to `true` as follows to write the log message to `stdout`:

```markup
./sampledb -local=true
```

The debug log will be printed out in `stdout`:

![Figure 2.2 – Log output from sampledb](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_2.2_B18295.jpg)

Figure 2.2 – Log output from sampledb

All info log messages will be printed out into the `logs.txt` file:

![Figure 2.3 – Log messages inside logs.txt](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_2.3_B18295.jpg)

Figure 2.3 – Log messages inside logs.txt

The logger is configured by the application using the `local` flag by calling the `SetLoggingOutput(..)` function:

```markup
func main() {
  l := flag.Bool(«local», false, «true - send to stdout, false                      - send to logging server»)
  flag.Parse()
  logger.SetLoggingOutput(*l)
  logger.Logger.Debugf(«Application logging to stdout =
                        %v», *l)
  ...
```

Two main functions in the wrapper code do most of the wrapping of the `golog` framework:

-   `configureLocal()`
-   `configureRemote()`

```markup
...
func configureLocal() {
  file, err := os.OpenFile(«logs.txt»,
                 os.O_APPEND|os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY, 0666)
  ...
  Logger.SetOutput(os.Stdout)
  Logger.SetLevel(«debug»)
  Logger.SetLevelOutput(«info», file)
}
...
```

The `configureLocal()` function is responsible for configuring logging to write to both `stdout` and the configured file named `logs.txt`. The function configured golog to set the output to `stdout` and the level to `debug`, which means that everything will be going to `stdout`.

The other function is `configureRemote()`, which configures golog to send all messages to the remote server in JSON format. The `SetLevelOutput()` function accepts the `io.Writer` interface, which the sample app has implemented to send all info log messages:

```markup
//configureRemote for remote logger configuration
func configureRemote() {
  r := remote{}
  Logger.SetLevelFormat(«info», «json»)
  Logger.SetLevelOutput(«info», r)
```

The `Write(data []byte)` function performs a `POST` operation, passing the log message to the logging server:

```markup
func (r remote) Write(data []byte) (n int, err error) {
  go func() {
     req, err := http.NewRequest("POST",
        «http://localhost:8010/log»,
        bytes.NewBuffer(data),
     )
     ...
        resp, _ := client.Do(req)

In this final section, we have learned how to create configurable logging that will allow applications to log either locally or remotely. This helps our application to be prepared and deployable in different environments.

# Summary

In this chapter, we have looked at different ways of adding log functionality to applications. We also learned about the `golog` library, which provides more flexibility and features than the standard library can offer. We looked at creating our own simple logging server that enables our application to send log information that can be used in a multi-service environment.

In the next chapter, we will look at how to add observability functionality to applications. We will look at tracing and metrics and go through the OpenTelemetry specification.
