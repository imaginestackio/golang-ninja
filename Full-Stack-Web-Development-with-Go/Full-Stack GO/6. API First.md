# Moving to API-First

In the previous chapters, we learned about building databases, adding monitoring to applications, using middleware, and session handling. In this chapter, we will learn about building an API in our application, and why an API is an important part of writing applications as it forms the interface between the frontend and the backend. Building the API first is important, as it forms the bridge for data exchanges and can be thought of as a contract between the frontend and the backend. Having the proper and correct form of contract is important before building an application.

We will also explore the concepts of REST and JSON to get a better understanding of what they are and how they are used throughout our application.

Upon completion of this chapter, you will know how to design a REST API using Gorilla Mux and also how to process requests to perform operations by converting data to and from JSON. You will also learn how to take care of error handling.

In this chapter, we’ll be covering the following topics:

-   Structuring API-first applications
-   Exposing REST APIs
-   Converting data to and from JSON using Go
-   Error handling using JSON

# Structuring an application

Go applications are structured inside directories, with each directory containing Go source code that means something for those applications. There are many ways to structure your Go application in different kinds of directories; however, one thing that you have to remember is to always give a directory a name that will be easy for others to understand. As an application grows with time, the chosen directory structure and where code is placed has a big impact on how easily other developers in your team will be able to work with the code base.

## Defining packages

Up to this point, we’ve kept things fairly simple, but we’re going to up our game a little and move to a fairly common layout. We won’t use the term “standard layout,” as there’s no such thing in Go, but we’ll look at how we’re structuring our new project and talk about how we reason them through to best structure our Go application for clarity and understanding, as shown in _Figure 6__.1_.

![Figure 6.1: Chapter 6 package structure](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_6.01_B18295.jpg)

Figure 6.1: Chapter 6 package structure

Let’s examine some of these files in a bit more detail to understand these decisions.

### generate.go

If you take a look at this file, it can appear confusing at first, but we’ve used a neat Go feature called `go generate` that can help:

```markup
package main
//go:generate echo Generating SQL Schemas
//go:generate sqlc generate
```

At a glance, it looks like a comment because comments in Go start with the `//` character. However, this one starts with the word `go:generate`. This is called the `go:generate` directive; what this means is that when `go generate` is executed (as shown in the following code block), it will execute the command specified – in our example, it will print the text `Generating SQL Schemas` and execute the sqlc command-line tool (`sqlc generate`):

```markup
$ go generate
Generating SQL Schemas
$
```

This is a useful technique to easily generate your build prerequisites; this can be done as part of your workflow, performed by `Makefile`, or done by your CI/CD. `Makefile` is a file containing sets of rules to determine which parts of a program need to be compiled and what command to use to compile the source code. It can be used to compile all kinds of programming language source code.

All we’re doing in our `generate.go` file is simply ensuring that we generate the latest schema files for sqlc. We could add mock generation, more informational messages, or generate archives or any manner of other useful things that might make up our build.

### handlers.go

This name comes purely from our experience in using the same pattern of naming files after the functionality defined therein. Our `handlers` file provides a single place (for now) where our HTTP handlers can be found. Ours contains login, logout, and all kinds of handlers and their request and response types needed to interact with our app. We don’t do anything outside of our handlers in this file; all connectivity and addition of middleware are performed as part of `main.go` to ensure the separation of concerns.

### internal/

In the “old days” of Go – back before 1.0 was released – the Go source code featured a directory called `pkg`, which was for internal-only code and became an idiom for the community, as well as a way to mark subfolders/packages as internal to a particular project.

The `pkg` folder was eventually removed from the Go project but it left a bit of an unfulfilled need, and to that end, the `internal` directory was created. `internal` is a special directory in so much as it is recognized by the Go tool itself, which allows an author to restrict importing the package unless they share a common ancestor. To demonstrate this, we’re storing our API package here as well as `env.go` (used to simplify a way to read environmental variables in the app) and `auth.go` (our specific way to handle authorization) – the `auth.go` or `handlers.go` files in particular are good options to prevent others from importing, while others like the `env` package are more general and can be moved up and out.

### migrations, queries, and store

Using `sqlc` and `golang-migrate`, we’ve given ourselves a leg up in making things easy to organize and increasing our ability to rapidly create our apps. We’re just separating things to make life a bit easier, as shown in the `sqlc.yaml` configuration file here:

```markup
path: store/
schema: migrations/
queries: queries/
```

To see how this works in practice, take a look at the `readme` file provided in the repo.

We have looked at structuring applications by separating different parts of an application into different folders. Grouping source code into different folders allows easier navigation of the application when doing maintenance and development. In the next section, we will explore building an API that will be used to consume data.

# Exposing our REST API

Let’s understand a few concepts that we are going to use in this section:

-   REST – **REST** stands for **Representational State Transfer**. It is a widely accepted set of guidelines for creating web services. REST is independent of the protocol used, but most of the time, it is tied to the HTTP protocol that normal web browsers use. Some of the design principles behind REST include the following:
    -   A resource has an identifier – for example, the URI for a particular order might be `https://what-ever-shop.com/orders/1`.
    -   Uses JSON as the exchange format – for example, a `GET` request to `https://what-ever-shop.com/orders/1` might return the following response body:
        
        ```markup
        {"orderId":1,"orderValue":0.99,"productId":100,"quantity":10}
        ```
        
    -   REST APIs built on HTTP are called using standard HTTP verbs to perform operations on resources. The most common operations are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.
-   API – **API** is an acronym for **Application Programming Interface**, a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. For example, if you are using the Google search engine, you are using an API that it provides.

Combining both the preceding concepts, we come up with a REST API, and the software that we are building is called a RESTful API, which means that the API that we provide can be accessed using REST.

In this section, we will look at exposing our RESTful handlers, a pattern for an API server, and discuss our new `middleware.Main` session and the API package.

We’ve done some rework to prepare our new API-first project. We’ve abstracted the API server into its own package in `internal/api`. Its responsibility is to provide a server that accepts a port to bind on and the ability to start the server, stop it, and add routes with optional middleware.

The following is a snippet (from `chapter06/main.go`) of our new main function showing this approach:

```markup
     1    func main() {
     2        ...
     3        server := api.NewServer(internal.GetAsInt(
                                      "SERVER_PORT", 9002))
     4
     5        server.MustStart()
     6        defer server.Stop()
     7
     8        defaultMiddleware := []mux.MiddlewareFunc{
     9            api.JSONMiddleware,
    10            api.CORSMiddleware(internal.GetAsSlice(
                      "CORS_WHITELIST",
    11                []string{
    12                    "http://localhost:9000",
    13                    "http://0.0.0.0:9000",
    14                }, ","),
    15            ),
    16        }
    17
    18        // Handlers
    19        server.AddRoute("/login", handleLogin(db),
                http.MethodPost, defaultMiddleware...)
    20        server.AddRoute("/logout", handleLogout(),
                http.MethodGet, defaultMiddleware...)
    21
    22        // Our session protected middleware
    23        protectedMiddleware :=
                append(defaultMiddleware,
                       validCookieMiddleware(db))
    24        server.AddRoute("/checkSecret",
                 checkSecret(db), http.MethodGet,
                 protectedMiddleware...)
    25
    26        ...
    27    }
```

Pay special attention to how we’ve created our default middleware, which is declared in the `defaultMiddleware` variable (line 8). For our protected routes, we are appending the `protectedMiddleware` variable (line 23) into the existing `defaultMiddleware` variable. Our custom session verification middleware is added to the middleware chain (line 23) to ensure a valid login before allowing access to our other handlers.

We’ve also pushed two types of middleware into this `api` package, `JSONMiddleware` (line 9) and `CORSMiddleware` (line 10), which takes a slice of strings for a **CORS** allow-list, which we’ll look at in more depth in the next section.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Anyone working with API-first applications will encounter the concept of CORS. It’s a security feature of modern browsers to ensure that web apps on one domain have permission to request APIs on a different origin. The way it does this is by performing what is called a preflight request, which is basically just a normal `OPTIONS` request. This returns information, telling our app that it is allowed to talk to the API endpoint, along with the methods it supports and the origins. Origins contain the same domain sent by the client in the `origin` header, or it could be a wildcard (`*`), which means that all origins are allowed, as explained in _Figure 6__.2_.

![Figure 6.2: CORS flow (sourced from Mozilla MDN and licensed under Creative Commons)](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781803234199/graphics/image/Figure_6.02_B18295.png)

Figure 6.2: CORS flow (sourced from Mozilla MDN and licensed under Creative Commons)

Our middleware wraps the Gorilla Mux CORS middleware to make it a little easier for us to provide our CORS whitelisted domains (the domains we’re happy to respond to requests on) and all the HTTP methods for those same domains.

## JSON middleware

Another piece of middleware that is functionally needed to enforce our requirements for an API-powered application is JSON middleware. **JSON**, short for **Javascript Object Notation**, is an open standard file format that is used to represent data in a key-value pair and arrays.

JSON middleware uses HTTP headers to check what kind of data is being sent in a request. It checks the `Content-Type` header key, which should contain the `application/json` value.

If it cannot find the value that it requires, then the middleware will check the value of the `Accept` header to see whether it can find the `application/json` value. Once the check is done and it cannot find the value that it is looking for, it replies that it’s not a suitable content type for us to work with. We also add that header to our `ResponseWriter` so that we can ensure we’re telling the consumer we only support JSON and send that back to them.

The following code snippet shows the JSON middleware:

```markup
     1    func JSONMiddleware(next http.Handler)
            http.Handler {
     2        return http.HandlerFunc(func(wr
                http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
     3            contentType :=
                    req.Header.Get("Content-Type")
     4
     5            if strings.TrimSpace(contentType) == "" {
     6                var parseError error
     7                contentType, _, parseError =
                        mime.ParseMediaType(contentType)
     8                if parseError != nil {
     9                    JSONError(wr,
                            http.StatusBadRequest,
                            "Bad or no content-type header
                             found")
    10                    return
    11                }
    12            }
    13
    14            if contentType != "application/json" {
    15                JSONError(wr,
                        http.StatusUnsupportedMediaType,
                        "Content-Type not
                         application/json")
    16                return
    17            }
    18            // Tell the client we're talking JSON as
                  // well.
    19            wr.Header().Add("Content-Type",
                                  "application/json")
    20            next.ServeHTTP(wr, req)
    21        })
    22    }
```

Line 14 checks whether the Content-Type header contains an `application/json` value; otherwise, it will return an error as part of the response (line 15).

Now that we understand the concept of middleware, we’ll develop some middleware to make handling our sessions easier.

## Session middleware

This session middleware does not fit into our `api` package as it’s closely tied to our session-handling functionality, as shown in the following code snippet:

```markup
     1    session, err := cookieStore.Get(req,
                                          "session-name")
     2    if err != nil {
     3       api.JSONError(wr,
                           http.StatusInternalServerError,
                           "Session Error")
     4       return
     5    }
     6
     7    userID, userIDOK :=
            session.Values["userID"].(int64)
     8    isAuthd, isAuthdOK :=
            session.Values["userAuthenticated"].(bool)
     9    if !userIDOK || !isAuthdOK {
    10       api.JSONError(wr,
               http.StatusInternalServerError,
               "Session Error")
    11       return
    12    }
    13
    14    if !isAuthd || userID < 1 {
    15       api.JSONError(wr, http.StatusForbidden,
                           "Bad Credentials")
    16       return
    17    }
    18    ...
    19    ctx := context.WithValue(req.Context(),
                                   SessionKey, UserSession{
    20       UserID: user.UserID,
    21    })
    22    h.ServeHTTP(wr, req.WithContext(ctx))
    23
```

What the preceding middleware does is attempt to retrieve our session from `cookiestore` (line 1), which we covered in the previous chapter. From the returned session map, we perform an assertion on two values (line 7) that assigns `userID` the `int64` value and the Boolean `userIDOK`.

Finally, if everything checks out, including a check of the database for the user, we use `context.WithValue()` (line 19) to provide a new context with our `sessionKey`, which is a unique type to our package.

We then provide a simple function called `userFromSession` that our handlers can call to check the validity of the key type and the incoming session data.

In this section, we learned about middleware and looked at adding different types of middleware to an application. Also, we looked at CORS and how it works when developing web applications. In the next section, we will look in more detail at JSON and use models to represent JSON for requests and responses.

# Converting to and from JSON

In this section, we will look at getting and sending data from and to JSON. We will also look at creating a structure to handle data and how the JSON conversion is done.

When dealing with JSON in Golang via the standard library, we’ve got two primary options –`json.Marshal/Unmarshal` and `json.NewEncoder(io.Writer)/NewDecoder(io.Reader)`. In this chapter, we will look at using the `Encoder`/`Decoder` methods. The reason for using these methods is that we can chain a function to the encoder/decoder that’s returned and call the `.Encode` and `.Decode` functions with ease. Another benefit of this approach is that it uses the streaming interface (namely `io.Reader` and `io.Writer`, used to represent an entity from/to which you can read or write a stream of bytes – the `Reader` and `Writer` interfaces are accepted as input and output by many utilities and functions in the standard library), so we have other choices than `Marshal`, which works with preallocated bytes, meaning we’re more efficient with our allocations and also faster.

## Defining request model

Data that flows through our application will be wrapped inside a struct. A struct is a structure that is defined to hold data. This makes it easier to transport data across different parts of the application; it does not make sense, if you have to transport 10 different pieces of data to different parts of the application, to do this by calling a function with 10 parameters, but if it is inside a struct, the function will only have to accept one parameter of that type. For simplicity, structs that hold data are also called models, as the field defined inside the struct is modeled on the data that it represents.

Let’s take a look at the model that we defined to wrap the login data (username and password) in the following code:

```markup
func handleLogin(db *sql.DB) http.HandlerFunc {
 return http.HandlerFunc(func(wr http.ResponseWriter, req    *http.Request) {
   type loginRequest struct {
    Username string `json:"username"`
    Password string `json:"password"`
   }
  ...
}
```

As seen in the preceding code, the `loginRequest` model is declared with a `json:"username"` definition. This tells the standard library JSON converter the following:

-   `username` – the key name used when converted to a JSON string
-   `omitempty` – if the value is empty, the key will not be included in the JSON string

More information can be found at [https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Marshal](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json#Marshal), where you can see the different configurations that a model can have to convert from/to JSON.

Now that we have defined the model inside the function, we want to use it. The `handleLogin` function uses the `Decode` function that exists inside the `json` standard library to decode the data, as shown in the following snippet:

```markup
payload := loginRequest{}
if err := json.NewDecoder(req.Body).Decode(&payload); err != nil {
 ...
}
```

Once successfully converted, the code can use the `payload` variable to access the values that were passed as part of the HTTP request.

Let’s take a look at another model that the code defines to store exercise set information that is passed by the user. The way to convert the data into `newSetRequest` is the same as `loginRequest` using the `Decode` function:

```markup
   1    func handleAddSet(db *sql.DB) http.HandlerFunc {
   2     return http.HandlerFunc(func(wr
           http.ResponseWriter,
           req *http.Request) {
   3
   4       ...
   5
   6       type newSetRequest struct {
   7        ExerciseName string
             `json:"exercise_name,omitempty"`
   8        Weight    int  `json:"weight,omitempty"`
   9       }
  10
  11       payload := newSetRequest{}
  12       if err := json.NewDecoder(req.Body)
             .Decode(&payload); err != nil {
  13         ...
  14        return
  15       }
  16
  17       ...
  18     })
  19    }
  20
```

The function declares a new struct (line 6) called `newSetRequest`, and this will be populated by calling the `json.NewDecoder()` function (line 12), which will be populated into the `payload` (line 11) variable.

In this section, we looked at using a model to host the information that is passed by the user. In the next section, we will look at sending responses back using the model.

## Defining a response model

In this section, we will look at how to use a model to host information that will be sent back as a response to the user. In [_Chapter 1_](https://subscription.imaginedevops.io/book/web-development/9781803234199/2B18295_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016), _Building the Database and Model_, we learned about sqlc tools that generate the different database models that will be used by our application. We will use the same database model defined by sqlc, converted to a JSON string as a response back to the user. The `json` package library is smart enough to convert models into JSON strings.

Let’s look at the response sent back when a user creates a new workout – in this case, the `handleAddSet` function, as shown here:

```markup
func handleAddSet(db *sql.DB) http.HandlerFunc {
 return http.HandlerFunc(func(wr http.ResponseWriter,
                              req *http.Request) {
   ...
   set, err :=
     querier.CreateDefaultSetForExercise(req.Context(),
       store.CreateDefaultSetForExerciseParams{
      WorkoutID:  int64(workoutID),
      ExerciseName: payload.ExerciseName,
      Weight:    int32(payload.Weight),
    })
   ...
   json.NewEncoder(wr).Encode(&set)
 })
}
```

As you can see, the function calls the `CreateDefaultSetForExercise` function and uses the `set` variable as a response back to the user by using the `Encode` function. The returned set variable is of type `GowebappSet`, which is defined as follows:

```markup
type GowebappSet struct {
 SetID    int64 `json:"set_id"`
 WorkoutID  int64 `json:"workout_id"`
 ExerciseName string `json:"exercise_name"`
 Weight    int32 `json:"weight"`
 Set1     int64 `json:"set1"`
 Set2     int64 `json:"set2"`
 Set3     int64 `json:"set3"`
}
```

When the model is converted using `Encode` and sent back as a response, this is how it will look:

```markup
{
 "set_id": 1,
 "workout_id": 1,
 "exercise_name": "Barbell",
 "weight": 700,
 "set1": 0,
 "set2": 0,
 "set3": 0
}
```

In this section, we looked at a model generated by sqlc that is not only used to host read/write data to and from a database but also used to send responses back to the user as a JSON string. In the next section, we will look at another important feature that we need to add to the application, error handling, which will be reported using JSON.

# Reporting errors with JSON

There are many ways to handle errors when writing web applications. In our sample application, we handle errors to inform users of what’s happening with their request. When reporting errors to users about their request, remember not to expose too much information about what’s happening to the system. The following are some examples of error messages reported to users that contain such information:

-   There is a connection error to the database
-   The username and password are not valid for connecting to the database
-   Username validation failed
-   The password cannot be converted to plain text

The preceding JSON error use cases are normally used in scenarios where more information needs to be provided to the frontend to inform users. Simpler error messages containing error codes can also be used.

## Using JSONError

Standardizing error messages is as important as writing proper code to ensure application maintainability. At the same time, it makes it easier for others to read and understand your code when troubleshooting.

In our sample application, we will use JSON to wrap error messages that are reported to the user. This ensures consistency in the format and content of the error. The following code snippet can be found inside the `internal/api/wrappers.go` file:

```markup
   1    func JSONError(wr http.ResponseWriter,
          errorCode int, errorMessages ...string) {
   2     wr.WriteHeader(errorCode)
   3     if len(errorMessages) > 1 {
   4       json.NewEncoder(wr).Encode(struct {
   5        Status string  `json:"status,omitempty"`
   6        Errors []string `json:"errors,omitempty"`
   7       }{
   8        Status: fmt.Sprintf("%d / %s", errorCode,
              http.StatusText(errorCode)),
   9        Errors: errorMessages,
  10       })
  11       return
  12     }
  13
  14     json.NewEncoder(wr).Encode(struct {
  15       Status string `json:"status,omitempty"`
  16       Error string `json:"error,omitempty"`
  17     }{
  18       Status: fmt.Sprintf("%d / %s", errorCode,
             http.StatusText(errorCode)),
  19       Error: errorMessages[0],
  20     })
  21    }
```

The `JSONError` function will use the passed `errorCode` parameter and `errorMessages(line 1)` as part of the JSON reported to the user – for example, let’s say we call the `/login` endpoint with the wrong credentials using the following cURL command:

```markup
curl http://localhost:9002/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{"username" : "user@user", "password" : "wrongpassword"}
```

You will get the following JSON error message:

```markup
{"status":"403 / Forbidden","error":"Bad Credentials"}
```

The error is constructed by using the struct that is defined when encoding the JSON string (line 14).

## Using JSONMessage

The sample application uses JSON not only for reporting error messages but also for reporting successful messages. Let’s take a look at the output of a successful message. Log in using the following cURL command:

```markup
curl http://localhost:9002/login -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{"username" : "user@user", "password" : "password"}'
```

You will get output that looks like this:

```markup
*  Trying ::1:9002...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 9002 (#0)
> POST /login HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:9002
…
< Set-Cookie: session-name=MTY0NTM0OTI1OXxEdi1CQkFFQ180SUFBUkFCRUFBQVJQLUNBQUlHYzNSeWFXNW5EQk1BRVhWelpYSkJkWFJvWlc1MGFXTmhkR1ZrQkdKdmIyd0NBZ0FCQm5OMGNtbHVad3dJQUFaMWMyVnlTVVFGYVc1ME5qUUVBZ0FDfHMy75qzLVPoMZ3BbNY17qBWd_puOhl6jpgY-d29ULUV; Path=/; Expires=Sun, 20 Feb 2022 09:42:39 GMT; Max-Age=900; HttpOnly
…
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
```

Using the `session-name` token, use the following cURL command to create a workout:

```markup
curl http://localhost:9002/workout -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST --cookie 'session-name=MTY0NTM0OTI1OXxEdi1CQkFFQ180SUFBUkFCRUFBQVJQLUNBQUlHYzNSeWFXNW 5EQk1BRVhWelpYSkJkWFJvWlc1MGFXTmhkR1ZrQkdKdmIyd0NBZ0FCQm5OM
GNtbHVad3dJQUFaMWMyVnlTVVFGYVc1ME5qUUVBZ0FDfHMy75qzLVPoMZ3BbNY 17qBWd_puOhl6jpgY-d29ULUV'
```

On successfully creating the workout, you will see a JSON message that looks like the following:

```markup
{"workout_id":3,"user_id":1,"start_date":"2022-02-20T09:29:25.406523Z"}
```

# Summary

In this chapter, we’ve looked at creating and leveraging our own middleware for session handling as well as enforcing JSON usage on our API. We’ve also reworked our project to use a common package layout to help separate our concerns and set ourselves up for future work and iteration.

Also in this chapter, we’ve introduced a number of helper functions, including two for creating and reporting errors and messages to the user via JSON and an API package to abstract our server handling, making it easy to understand and preparing us to accommodate CORS.

In the next chapter, we will discuss writing frontends in more detail and learn how to write frontend applications using a frontend framework.
